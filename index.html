Is your blog under construction in perpetuity? Is your personal creative space a
thing which transcends definition and is continuously shapeshifting to
approximate an expression that you are comfortable with?

Cool.

Make a pull request against <a href="https://github.com/tdfischer/under-construction">this repo</a> to add yourself to the ring.json file.

Then, embed the following in your Super Cool Web Page:

<pre>
&lt;iframe src="https://tdfischer.github.io/under-construction/embed.html"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
</pre>

And you'll get this:

<iframe src="embed.html" width="100%" height="250">
</iframe>

Recommended image size is 122px square, and tacky as frick.
