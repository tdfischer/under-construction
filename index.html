Cool.

Make a pull request against this repo to add yourself to the ring.json file.

Then, embed the following in your Super Cool Web Page:

&lt;iframe src="https://tdfischer.github.io/under-construction/embed.html"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
</pre>

And you'll get this:

<iframe src="embed.html" width="100%" height="250">
</iframe>
